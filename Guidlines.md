# 📘 Team Guidelines – Hackathon Project

This document explains **how the team works together** during the hackathon.

Everyone must follow these rules to avoid confusion, conflicts, and last-minute problems.

These rules stay **fixed for the entire hackathon**.

---

## 🎯 Main Goal

- Build **one working MVP**
- Keep the project stable
- Prepare a confident final demo

---

## 🧱 How the System Is Structured

- Frontend (React + Tailwind) handles UI and user flow
- Backend (Django + FastAPI) handles logic and APIs
- Database (PostgreSQL) stores data
- Backend connects frontend and database

No direct frontend ↔ database connection.

---

## 🏷️ Naming Rules (Very Important)

- We use **snake_case everywhere**
- Applies to:
  - API request and response data
  - Database tables and columns
  - Frontend variables and state

Once a name is decided, **it must not change**.

---

## 📦 Data & API Rules

- Data fields are defined once and shared by everyone
- Frontend uses API data exactly as defined
- Backend guarantees API behavior
- Database follows the same meaning of fields

No silent or sudden changes.

---

## 👥 Team Responsibilities

### Frontend
- Build UI screens
- Follow shared data names
- Focus on demo-ready UI

### Backend
- Build APIs and business logic
- Keep API responses stable
- Handle integration

### Database
- Design tables based on shared data
- Keep names consistent
- Avoid unnecessary fields

### Team Coordination
- Fix mismatches early
- Stop adding features after MVP works
- Protect demo stability

---

## ⏱️ How We Work Together

1. Agree on MVP and data
2. Work in parallel
3. Integrate step by step
4. Fix issues early
5. Freeze features and rehearse demo

---

## 🚫 Important Rules

- No renaming fields
- No breaking API behavior
- No last-minute big changes
- No overengineering

---

## 🏁 Final Rule

> A simple working demo is better than a complex broken project.

This file is the **main rulebook for teamwork**.
