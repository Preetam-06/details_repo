# 🌿 Git Workflow – Hackathon Team Guide

This document explains how the team uses **Git and GitHub** during the hackathon.

The goal is to keep the project safe, clean, and demo-ready.

---

## 👥 Team & Branches

- Adarsh – Frontend  
  Branch: `frontend-adarsh`

- Sitaram – Backend  
  Branch: `backend-sitaram`

- Piyush – Database  
  Branch: `database-piyush`

- Preetam – Team Lead  
  Reviews code, handles integration, and merges to `main`

---

## 🌳 Branch Rules

- `main` is the final demo branch
- No one pushes directly to `main`
- Everyone works only on their own branch
- All changes go through Pull Requests

---

## 🔁 Daily Workflow

1. Pull latest `main`
2. Work on your branch
3. Make small commits
4. Push changes regularly
5. Create a Pull Request when ready

---

## 🔍 Pull Requests

- Clearly explain what was changed
- Keep PRs focused on one area
- Follow rules in `GUIDELINES.md`

Only approved PRs are merged.

---

## 🚫 What Not To Do

- No direct push to `main`
- No working on other branches
- No mixing frontend, backend, and DB in one PR
- No force push without discussion

---

## 🏁 Final Rule

> If it’s not reviewed, it doesn’t go to `main`.

This workflow keeps the project stable and stress-free.
